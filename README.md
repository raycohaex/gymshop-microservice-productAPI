## Setup
To run this project you simply navigate to the project folder and simply run: `dotnet build`

In order to configure the project correctly you will need to use a database. 
The database should be a MariaDB mysql database configured for UTF-8.
Your appsettings.json file should look like this:
```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DatabaseConnection": "Server=<<SERVER>>; Port=<<PORT>>; Database=<<Database Name>>; Uid=<<USER>>; pwd=<<PASSWORD>>;"
  }
}
```
You will need to run `Update-Datbase` in order to create the proper database schemes.
